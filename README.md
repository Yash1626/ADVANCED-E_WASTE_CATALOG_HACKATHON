# E-waste Monitoring System

## Overview

The E-waste Monitoring System is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate the management, recycling, and tracking of electronic waste. This system serves two primary user groups: consumers and organizations. It provides a user-friendly interface for consumers to log their e-waste, request pickups, or visit e-waste collection stations, and allows organizations to manage pickup orders, view reward requests, and generate reports.

## Features

### For Consumers:
1. **Log E-waste Items**: Categorize and log e-waste items, provide performance ratings, and choose between scheduling a pickup or visiting a collection station.
2. **View E-waste History**: Access and review a history of logged e-waste items.
3. **Check Status**: View the status of pickup requests, store visits, and reward points balance.
4. **Redeem Rewards**: Redeem reward points, which are then sent to the user's email, with rewards points reset to zero.

### For Organizations:
1. **Check Pickup Orders**: View pickup orders and the associated pincodes from which requests have been made.
2. **View Reward Requests**: Access a list of reward redemption requests.
3. **View Reports**: Generate and review various reports related to e-waste collection.
4. **Check Total Delivery Fee Accumulated**: Review the total delivery fees accumulated.

## Values

Our system is designed with the following core values in mind:

- **Sustainability**: Promoting responsible disposal and recycling of electronic waste to reduce environmental impact.
- **Transparency**: Providing clear and accessible information for both consumers and organizations regarding e-waste management and rewards.
- **Innovation**: Continuously improving our system to incorporate new technologies and methodologies for better e-waste management.

## Future Developments

We envision the E-waste Monitoring System evolving into a comprehensive model that can integrate with various organizations. Future enhancements may include:

- **Cryptocurrency Rewards**: Partnering with organizations to offer cryptocurrency as a reward redemption option, providing a modern and flexible reward system.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implementing advanced analytics to provide deeper insights into e-waste trends and management.
- **Expanded Partnerships**: Collaborating with more organizations and stakeholders to enhance the system's reach and impact.
